Created a little site (this one!) for me to post links and projects I'm interested in. I've procrastinated publishing content for the longest time, realized I could just do something bare bones and be done with it. 

Using a static-site-generator type pattern, just wrote a little compile.js script to turn markdown files into a index page & post pages. Hosting with GH Pages.
